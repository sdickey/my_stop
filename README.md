### My Stop

I'm Sean Dickey and I originally developed this application in May 2014 as
my Phase 2 final project at Dev Bootcamp, San Francisco. I got the idea when my
friend Alejandro fell asleep on the train and missed his stop. One hour and a
scary cab ride later, Ale finally made it home that night. So I
thought that an app that would text you when your destination was approaching
would be a cool thing to build. A week after I developed MyStop, Ale told me
that Google just announced similar functionality via Google Maps. Crazy.

### Disclaimer

I make no claims to the accuracy or reliability of this application. Cell phones
lose power, they lose signals, my math could be wrong, aliens could invade,
wiping out the internet to cripple our efforts to mount a defense. The point
is that I built this thing to advance my skills as a web developer. It's not
perfect, so use it at your own risk. Werd.
